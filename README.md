Mort's C Utilities
==================

glob
----

Implementation of the builting `glob` function, which mattered to me
at some point for some reason I now forget.


loadup
------

Ensure that _M_ of _N_ processes are kept running at once, until all
_N_ are completed.


nohup
-----

Replacement for the poxy GNU `nohup` script which annoyed me for some
reason at some point.


range
-----

Implementation of Python's `range` builtin, before I found out about
`seq` or, on BSD-like OSes, e.g., OSX, `jot`.
